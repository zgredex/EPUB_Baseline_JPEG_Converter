## Features

### Simple & Advanced Modes
- **Simple Mode** (default): Drop files, convert, download. No configuration needed.
- **Advanced Mode**: Full control with quality settings, image selection grid, detailed logs, and validation info.

### Image Conversion
- **Format conversion**: PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP → baseline JPEG
- **Quality control**: 1-95% JPEG quality with presets (Low 60%, Medium 75%, High 85%, Max 95%)
- **Smart scaling**: Automatically scales images to fit e-reader screen (default 480×800)
- **Grayscale mode**: Converts all images to grayscale for e-ink displays

### Rotate & Split Mode
Optimized for manga and light novels with horizontal spread images:
- **Manual image selection**: Choose which images to process via thumbnail grid
- **Reading order**: Images displayed in OPF spine order for accurate selection
- **Quick selection**: "Select Landscape" button auto-selects wide images
- Rotates selected landscape images 90° clockwise
- Splits into multiple pages with configurable overlap (default 15%)
- Right-to-left page order for correct reading flow
- Generates unique IDs for split elements to maintain EPUB validity

### EPUB Repairs
- **SVG cover fix**: Unwraps images from problematic SVG containers
- **SVG-wrapped images**: Detects and fixes `<svg><image xlink:href="..."/></svg>` patterns
- **Cover metadata**: Ensures `<meta name="cover" content="..."/>` exists in OPF
- **Manifest sync**: Updates image references and media-types after conversion
- **NCX identifier sync**: Synchronizes `dtb:uid` with OPF `dc:identifier`
- **EPUB OCF compliance**: Writes `mimetype` as first uncompressed entry

### Batch Processing
- Drop multiple EPUB files at once
- Individual progress tracking
- Combined statistics (total saved, conversion count)
- Download all as single ZIP file

## Usage

### Simple Mode (Default)
1. Drag & drop an EPUB file onto the drop zone
2. Click **Convert to Baseline JPEG**
3. Download the converted EPUB

Default settings: 85% quality, grayscale ON, no rotation/split.

### Advanced Mode
1. Toggle **⚙️ Advanced Mode** below the drop zone
2. Drop an EPUB file
3. Adjust JPEG quality if needed
4. Select images for Rotate & Split in the thumbnail grid
5. Toggle Grayscale on/off
6. Click **Convert to Baseline JPEG**
7. Review detailed logs and stats
8. Download the converted EPUB

### Batch Mode
1. Drop multiple EPUB files at once
2. Configure quality settings (applies to all)
3. Click **Convert All**
4. Download individual files or **Download All as ZIP**

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| JPEG Quality | 85% | Compression level (1-95%). Lower = smaller file, higher = better quality |
| Rotate & Split | OFF | Manually select images to rotate and split for vertical e-readers |
| Grayscale | ON | Convert all images to grayscale |
| Screen Width | 480px | Target e-reader screen width |
| Screen Height | 800px | Target e-reader screen height |
| Split Overlap | 15% | Overlap between split pages (Rotate & Split mode) |

## Technical Details

### Image Processing Pipeline

```
1. Load image from EPUB
2. Convert to RGB (handle RGBA/LA/P modes)
3. Check dimensions vs screen size
4. If image selected for Rotate & Split AND is landscape AND exceeds screen:
   a. Scale width to screen height (800px)
   b. Rotate 90° clockwise
   c. Split into pages (right-to-left) with overlap
5. Otherwise: scale to fit screen
6. Encode as baseline JPEG (non-progressive)
7. Update all references (XHTML, OPF, CSS, NCX)
```

### Split Algorithm (Rotate & Split Mode)

For a 1600×800 rotated image on 480×800 screen with 15% overlap:
- Effective width per page: 480 × (1 - 0.15) = 408px
- Number of parts: ceil((1600 - 480×0.15) / 408) = 4 parts
- Extraction order: right → left (maintains reading flow after rotation)

### EPUB Modifications

| File Type | Modifications |
|-----------|---------------|
| Images | Convert format, scale, rotate, split |
| XHTML | Update `<img>` src, duplicate elements for splits, fix IDs |
| OPF | Update manifest hrefs, media-types, add split image entries, ensure cover meta |
| NCX | Sync `dtb:uid` with OPF identifier |
| CSS | Update image references |

### Validation

Pre-conversion checks:
- ✓ Valid ZIP structure
- ✓ `mimetype` file present
- ✓ OPF file exists
- ✓ Images found for conversion

Post-conversion checks:
- ✓ All images successfully converted
- ✓ Manifest references valid
- ✓ `mimetype` is first entry (OCF compliance)

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Chrome 90+ | ✅ Full support |
| Firefox 88+ | ✅ Full support |
| Safari 14+ | ✅ Full support |
| Edge 90+ | ✅ Full support |

**Requirements**: Modern browser with ES2020 support, Canvas API, File API

## File Size Estimates

Typical compression results (85% quality, grayscale enabled):

| Source Format | Reduction |
|---------------|-----------|
| PNG (lossless) | 70-90% smaller |
| WebP | 30-50% smaller |
| High-quality JPEG | 20-40% smaller |
| Already optimized JPEG | ~0% (passthrough) |
